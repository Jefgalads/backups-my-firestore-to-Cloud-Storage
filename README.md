# backups-my-firestore-to-Cloud-Storage
Firebase extension for scheduled Firestore backups to Cloud Storage
# 🔁 Firestore Scheduled Backup Extension

This Firebase Extension automatically exports your Firestore database to a Cloud Storage bucket on a schedule.  
It supports **Node.js 20 / Cloud Functions 2nd Gen** and avoids the Node.js 18 runtime issue.

---

## ✨ Features
- Scheduled backups using cron syntax (e.g., quarterly, monthly).
- Exports **all collections** or only specified ones.
- Stores backups in Cloud Storage with timestamped folder names.
- Retries automatically if a path collision occurs.
- Works across multiple Firebase projects.
